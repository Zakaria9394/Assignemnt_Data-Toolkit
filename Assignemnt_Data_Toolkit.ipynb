        "15] How does NumPy handle multidimensional arrays\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy uses the ndarray object to handle multidimensional arrays efficiently. It supports fast operations across axes, broadcasting for element-wise operations, and slicing for easy data access. Internally, it stores data in contiguous memory blocks, enabling high-speed computations.\n",
        "16] What is the role of Bokeh in data visualization\n",
        "\n",
        "Bokeh is a Python library for creating interactive, web-based visualizations. It enables real-time updates, supports large datasets, and allows linking multiple plots with user controls (like sliders or dropdowns). It’s ideal for building dashboards and embedding visuals in web apps.\n",
